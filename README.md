# WebAccessibility  

**WebAccessibility** is a project designed to make computers and the web more inclusive for everyone.

## Features  
- Hand tracking for mouse control  
- Facial movements for mouse control  
- AI-powered gesture recognition for volume control  
- Chrome extension for seamless browsing  
- Built with inclusivity at its core  

## Vision  
To ensure that technology is accessible to people of all abilities, making the web a truly inclusive space.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **MediaPipe**  
- **OpenCV**
